# Web Style Guide

My fourth project for the Treehouse Front-End Development Techdegree (see [here](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/front-end-web-development-techdegree/)).



## Tech Stack

- HTML
- SCSS



## Description

This was the first project I built using SCSS. The goal of the project was to build a component library that uses SCSS features like mixins, placeholders, and variables. This was a very demanding project, due in part to the wide variety of custom styles and mobile/desktop designs.
